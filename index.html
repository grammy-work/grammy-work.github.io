Hi everyone, I'm currently living in Portugal and working as an architect for a world-renowned IT organization. 
I am very satisfied and proud to provide professional services to this crew and their customers. However, due to my personality and habits, I tend to separate my work identity from my virtual identity (or more to the point, meta-identity), so I won't be mentioning anything related to my work and profession in this site, but it doesn't mean that I don't have a love or respect for the business I'm working for. In particular, if you know me from my work identity (e.g. a colleague or customer I serve), please understand this.
